## Background
You are selling to a Fortune 1000 clothing retailer, RetailNext, that operates a vast network of department stores. RetailNext is aiming to leverage advanced AI technologies to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and gain a competitive edge in the market. Your task is to develop and demonstrate a technical solution that showcases how this technology can be applied to solve real-world problems within the organization.
 

## Problem Statement
Assume that you have had a meeting with your Account Director and champion from RetailNext to prepare for your meeting with their Head of Innovation and CTO. 

They have highlighted customers recently leaving poor reviews due to inability to find updated styles or specific items in stores for upcoming events.
 
## The process
You and your Account Director have identified [this cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_combine_gpt4o_with_rag_outfit_assistant) ([sample data](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/data/sample_clothes) is here) which was recently created from a similar customer situation. Now you need to prepare to present it as a solution that relates to their business initiatives.

You will now prepare a presentation and demo for RetailNext.

Please do at least one of the following:
- Leverage the cookbook to build a front-end UI that you can demo to executives at RetailNext.
- Add an AI feature not included in the cookbook that might benefit RetailNext’s business.

Please prepare a short presentation to set the stage (should be 5-10 mins during onsite)
Describe the business situation at RetailNext – feel free to make assumptions that would have been surfaced in previous discovery calls.
Describe OpenAI’s platform.
Describe the solution and business value – make sure to include an overview of the OpenAI technologies being used and their value.
Include solution, architecture, or process flow diagrams that describe your solution
Note: Using AI coding tools to assist you in building your demo is recommended.
 
For your submission:
A video walking through what you built on the front end or the AI feature you added. Please keep submission to under 6 minutes.
Your video submission is not a demo to executives. We are purely assessing if you are able to build on top of the cookbook and explain the code.
PDF of Slides that you would use in the presentation
No need to include a walkthrough of this in your video.
Onsite Next Steps
If you move forward after submission, you will present this to members of the Solutions Engineering leadership team who will play the roles of “Head of Innovation” and “CTO”.
 
There will be 45-minutes allotted for this portion. Please plan for:
20 minute presentation and demo,
10 minutes of questions throughout, or at the end whilst still in role-play mode
The remainder of the time will be for experiential based questions from the team.
It's completely up to you how you demo this solution (this is not a trick question). Please consider how to best present the solution to an executive audience of both technical and business stakeholders.
 
Again, we are evaluating your technical and solution selling skills so based on how you have crafted the solution and how you think this audience will best receive said solution, we are giving you the creative liberty to decide what's best. Please note that we will be assessing on Business Outcomes and Technical Competency equally.
 
Please purchase $30 on the API and let Charlene (cc'd) know once done and we will send you the reimbursement form.
