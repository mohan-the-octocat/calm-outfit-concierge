# ST-17 Intent Prompt Pack

## Description
Design prompts/few-shot examples for intent parsing (identity, occasion, vibe, optional image attributes) with enforced JSON schema.

## Expected Result
Prompt reliably returns schema-compliant JSON on test fixtures; field fill rate ≥90% on curated test set; no hallucinated fields.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Prompt text checked into repo with schema contract.
  - Audit: Added `prompts/intent/prompt.md` and `prompts/intent/schema.json`.
- [x] Test harness with fixtures; asserts schema validity and field completeness.
  - Audit: Added fixture set and validation script (`scripts/validate_prompt_packs.mjs`).
- [x] Uses gpt-4o/4o-mini per cost/latency guidance.
  - Audit: Prompt pack specifies mini-first with 4o retry policy.
- [x] Documented failure/retry policy (e.g., mini fallback).
  - Audit: Added explicit 3-step retry/fallback sequence in prompt doc.
