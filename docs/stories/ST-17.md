# ST-17 Intent Prompt Pack

## Description
Design prompts/few-shot examples for intent parsing (identity, occasion, vibe, optional image attributes) with enforced JSON schema.

## Expected Result
Prompt reliably returns schema-compliant JSON on test fixtures; field fill rate ≥90% on curated test set; no hallucinated fields.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Prompt text checked into repo with schema contract.
- [ ] Test harness with fixtures; asserts schema validity and field completeness.
- [ ] Uses gpt-4o/4o-mini per cost/latency guidance.
- [ ] Documented failure/retry policy (e.g., mini fallback).
