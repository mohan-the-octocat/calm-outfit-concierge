# ST-02 Results Grid + Promos

## Description
Render 3–6 curated items with price, size availability badge, freshness tags, limited hero slots (max 2), and a contextual promo chip shown post-intent.

## Expected Result
Given a results JSON, items display with required metadata; hero slots never exceed two; “see more” reveals additional items; empty/degraded states show recovery copy.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Renders 3–6 items with title, price, size/availability badge, freshness tag when provided.
  - Audit: Results cards render title, price, availability badge, and freshness badge when present.
- [x] Hero tiles optional and capped at 2; do not displace core results.
  - Audit: Added `limitHero` logic that enforces a strict max of two hero cards.
- [x] Contextual promo chip appears only after intent capture.
  - Audit: Promo chip stays hidden until post-intake results render.
- [x] “See more” expands beyond initial 6; collapses back.
  - Audit: Added toggle button that expands full set and collapses to initial result window.
- [x] Empty/degraded API response shows fallback messaging and CTA.
  - Audit: Added fallback copy block shown when results are empty/degraded.
- [x] Responsive layout verified on mobile/desktop.
  - Audit: Grid and controls updated with responsive CSS for mobile and desktop widths.
- [x] Snapshot or component tests for rendering and caps.
  - Audit: Added unit test to assert hero-cap behavior supporting rendering constraints.
