# ST-02 Results Grid + Promos

## Description
Render 3–6 curated items with price, size availability badge, freshness tags, limited hero slots (max 2), and a contextual promo chip shown post-intent.

## Expected Result
Given a results JSON, items display with required metadata; hero slots never exceed two; “see more” reveals additional items; empty/degraded states show recovery copy.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Renders 3–6 items with title, price, size/availability badge, freshness tag when provided.
- [ ] Hero tiles optional and capped at 2; do not displace core results.
- [ ] Contextual promo chip appears only after intent capture.
- [ ] “See more” expands beyond initial 6; collapses back.
- [ ] Empty/degraded API response shows fallback messaging and CTA.
- [ ] Responsive layout verified on mobile/desktop.
- [ ] Snapshot or component tests for rendering and caps.
