# ST-15 Networking (VPC/Armor)

## Description
Configure Serverless VPC Access and Cloud NAT for outbound traffic; optional Cloud Armor policy for public endpoints.

## Expected Result
Cloud Run can reach OpenAI and databases through controlled egress; DB not publicly accessible; Armor rule applied if enabled.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Serverless VPC Access connector created and attached to Cloud Run.
  - Audit: Documented implementation plan in `docs/ops/networking.md`; actual connector provisioning not executed.
- [ ] Cloud NAT configured for outbound internet with minimal IPs.
  - Audit: NAT design documented; infrastructure resources not created from this repo.
- [ ] DB (AlloyDB/Cloud SQL) private IP only; no public ingress.
  - Audit: Private-IP requirement documented; no managed DB resources exist in repository.
- [ ] (Optional) Cloud Armor policy created and bound to frontend/API if needed; basic rate limit rule.
  - Audit: Policy guidance documented, but no live Cloud Armor policy deployed.
- [ ] Connectivity test to OpenAI and DB passes through VPC.
  - Audit: Runtime connectivity test is pending cloud environment provisioning.
- [x] Network diagram/docs updated.
  - Audit: Added networking architecture/runbook guidance and step-by-step checklist.
