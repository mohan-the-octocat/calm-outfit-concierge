# ST-08 Fulfillment API (ETA/cutoffs)

## Description
Compute pickup ETA and shipping options (same-day/express/standard) using SLA tables and store hours; handle timezones and cut-offs.

## Expected Result
Given store/location and SLA data, returns sorted options with arrival windows; cut-offs applied; missing SLA falls back to pickup-first.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SLA and store hours parsed with timezone awareness.
- [ ] Cut-off logic produces correct next-eligible window when past cut-off.
- [ ] Output sorted by earliest arrival; marks fastest.
- [ ] Fallback when SLA missing/unreachable.
- [ ] Tests across timezones and edge times (just before/after cut-off).
