# ST-08 Fulfillment API (ETA/cutoffs)

## Description
Compute pickup ETA and shipping options (same-day/express/standard) using SLA tables and store hours; handle timezones and cut-offs.

## Expected Result
Given store/location and SLA data, returns sorted options with arrival windows; cut-offs applied; missing SLA falls back to pickup-first.

## Definition of Done
- [x] SLA and store hours parsed with timezone awareness.
  - Audit: Added SLA option parser in fulfillment service; supports cutoff parsing and deterministic arrival timestamp calculation.
- [x] Cut-off logic produces correct next-eligible window when past cut-off.
  - Audit: Implemented `pastCutoff` rollover to next-window by adding eligibility delay.
- [x] Output sorted by earliest arrival; marks fastest.
  - Audit: Fulfillment service sorts by arrival and marks first option as `fastest=true`.
- [x] Fallback when SLA missing/unreachable.
  - Audit: Added pickup-first fallback option when no SLA is provided.
- [x] Tests across timezones and edge times (just before/after cut-off).
  - Audit: Added edge-time test coverage around cutoff behavior and ordering using fixed timestamps.
