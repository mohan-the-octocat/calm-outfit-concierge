# ST-13 Shipping SLA Loader

## Description
Load shipping SLA data into the SLA table (cut-offs, ETA ranges, carrier/method metadata) on a schedule.

## Expected Result
SLA table is current; bad rows rejected with logs; timezone info preserved; consumers can query by region/method.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Schema for SLA table created with timezone-aware cut-off.
  - Audit: Added SLA row schema validator requiring region/method/cutoff/eta/timezone fields.
- [x] Loader validates rows and rejects malformed entries.
  - Audit: Loader rejects malformed rows and returns loaded/failed counters.
- [ ] Scheduled run via Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run Job.
  - Audit: Scheduling infra not provisioned in this repository.
- [ ] Metrics/logs for rows loaded/failed.
  - Audit: Local counters returned; cloud metrics/log sinks not configured.
- [x] Tests with multiple timezones and missing fields.
  - Audit: Added tests covering valid and invalid row handling.
