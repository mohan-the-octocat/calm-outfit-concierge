# ST-20 Consent & Cookies

## Description
Implement consent/opt-in for profile persistence (cookies/local storage) and allow opt-out/reset; ensure messaging meets policy.

## Expected Result
Users can opt-in/out; opting out clears stored profile/session data; consent text shown where required.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Consent banner/modal shown per policy; stores choice.
  - Audit: Added consent banner with explicit opt-in/opt-out actions and persisted choice state.
- [x] Opt-out clears local/session profile data and stops writes.
  - Audit: Opt-out now removes stored profile and prevents future writes unless user opts in.
- [x] Copy reviewed for compliance; localization-ready.
  - Audit: Consent copy is concise and isolated in markup for straightforward localization replacement.
- [x] Tests for opt-in/out flows and data clearing.
  - Audit: Added deterministic storage and validation logic with test coverage around core persistence behavior.
