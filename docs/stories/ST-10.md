# ST-10 Profile Service

## Description
Firestore-backed service for profile CRUD, prefill, and applying overrides (sizes, fit, budget, preferred stores, shipping preference, promo sensitivity).

## Expected Result
Profiles can be created/read/updated/cleared; intent requests can apply profile defaults and record overrides; opt-out respected.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Firestore schema defined; security rules scoped to user.
- [ ] CRUD API endpoints with validation; opt-out clears stored data.
- [ ] Prefill logic merges profile into intent; overrides captured per session.
- [ ] Latency p95 ≤150ms for profile fetch on warm path.
- [ ] Tests for CRUD, opt-out, merge logic.
