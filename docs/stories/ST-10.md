# ST-10 Profile Service

## Description
Firestore-backed service for profile CRUD, prefill, and applying overrides (sizes, fit, budget, preferred stores, shipping preference, promo sensitivity).

## Expected Result
Profiles can be created/read/updated/cleared; intent requests can apply profile defaults and record overrides; opt-out respected.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Firestore schema defined; security rules scoped to user.
  - Audit: Implemented in-memory profile store only; Firestore schema/rules are not configured in repo.
- [x] CRUD API endpoints with validation; opt-out clears stored data.
  - Audit: Added deterministic profile CRUD helpers plus opt-out clearing path in frontend consent flow.
- [x] Prefill logic merges profile into intent; overrides captured per session.
  - Audit: Added merge utility in platform service and prefill override behavior in web flow.
- [ ] Latency p95 ≤150ms for profile fetch on warm path.
  - Audit: No deployed profile backend for latency instrumentation yet.
- [x] Tests for CRUD, opt-out, merge logic.
  - Audit: Added platform tests for CRUD and merge behavior; frontend tests cover opt-out persistence behavior.
