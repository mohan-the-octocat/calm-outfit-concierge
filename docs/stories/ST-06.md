# ST-06 Intent Parse API

## Description
FastAPI endpoint that accepts intake payload (answers + optional image URL), calls OpenAI (gpt-4o/4o-mini) to produce structured intent JSON, with moderation handling.

## Expected Result
Returns JSON matching schema (identity, occasion, vibe, optional image attrs); rejects/flags unsafe content; p95 ≤2.5s on text-only requests.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] OpenAPI schema published; validates request/response.
- [ ] Calls gpt-4o/4o-mini with prompt; enforces JSON output.
- [ ] Moderation via omni-moderation; blocks/flags unsafe input.
- [ ] Unit tests with fixtures for happy/edge cases; schema compliance tests.
- [ ] Latency budget met on sampled runs (text flow).
