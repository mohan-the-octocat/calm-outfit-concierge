# ST-16 Monitoring/Logging

## Description
Set up Cloud Logging/Monitoring dashboards and alerts for API latency, error rates, OpenAI call failures, and ETL freshness.

## Expected Result
Dashboards show p95 latency (text/image flows), error rates, OpenAI failure counts, inventory/injest staleness; alerts fire on SLO breach.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Log-based metrics for API latency and error rate created.
- [ ] Dashboards for p95 latency (text vs image), OpenAI error counts, ETL recency.
- [ ] Alerts for latency SLO breach, 5xx rate, ETL freshness SLA.
- [ ] Runbook links in alerts; owners set.
- [ ] Tested alert by synthetic breach.
