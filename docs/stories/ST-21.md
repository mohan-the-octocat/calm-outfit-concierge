# ST-21 Automated Tests

## Description
Set up automated tests across API, components, vector filters, ETA logic, and prompt schema validation; integrate into CI.

## Expected Result
CI runs unit/integration tests; regressions caught on PR; coverage thresholds defined.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test suites for API endpoints (contract), retrieval filters, ETA logic, prompt schema validators.
- [ ] Frontend component tests for key flows (intake, results, fulfillment rail).
- [ ] CI executes tests on push/PR; fails on coverage drop below threshold.
- [ ] Basic fixtures/mocks for OpenAI and DB to avoid live calls.
- [ ] Documentation on running tests locally and in CI.
