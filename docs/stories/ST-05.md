# ST-05 Alternates & Notify-me

## Description
Handle out-of-stock or no-match results by suggesting nearest alternatives and offering a “notify me” capture.

## Expected Result
When items unavailable, alternates render; if none, a notify-me form collects contact (email/phone) with validation and confirmation state.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Alternates list renders from payload; clicking replaces selection in detail view.
- [ ] Notify-me form validates email/phone; shows success state; no duplicate submits.
- [ ] Empty results state offers broaden-filters CTA.
- [ ] Accessible form labels and error messaging.
- [ ] Tests cover validation and alternate selection.
