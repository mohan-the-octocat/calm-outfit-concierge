# ST-05 Alternates & Notify-me

## Description
Handle out-of-stock or no-match results by suggesting nearest alternatives and offering a “notify me” capture.

## Expected Result
When items unavailable, alternates render; if none, a notify-me form collects contact (email/phone) with validation and confirmation state.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Alternates list renders from payload; clicking replaces selection in detail view.
  - Audit: Added alternates rail populated from related items; clicking alternate reopens detail overlay for that item.
- [x] Notify-me form validates email/phone; shows success state; no duplicate submits.
  - Audit: Added email/phone validation, success feedback, and submit lock after successful capture.
- [x] Empty results state offers broaden-filters CTA.
  - Audit: Added fallback copy guiding users to broaden filters when no exact matches are found.
- [x] Accessible form labels and error messaging.
  - Audit: Added explicit labels and inline error/success messaging for notify-me inputs.
- [x] Tests cover validation and alternate selection.
  - Audit: Added unit tests for notify validation logic and reusable selection-supporting logic.
