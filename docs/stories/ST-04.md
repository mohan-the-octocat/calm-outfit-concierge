# ST-04 Detail Overlay (size/store/returns/reserve)

## Description
Lightweight overlay with item details: size selector, store selector, return policy flag, price+promo clarity, and optional “reserve for pickup” with hold timer UI.

## Expected Result
Users can pick size/store, view return eligibility, see applied promo/price, and reserve pickup (when enabled) with visible hold countdown; CTA deep-links to checkout/reserve URL.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Renders size selector with availability per size; disabled when unavailable.
- [ ] Store selector present when multiple stores; fallback to default store.
- [ ] Return/exchange eligibility badge displayed (e.g., Final Sale).
- [ ] Price shows base + applied promo info (if provided).
- [ ] Reserve option shows hold timer and release state when hold=true.
- [ ] CTA deep-link uses provided URL params (item, size, store).
- [ ] Keyboard/ARIA labels for selectors and CTA.
- [ ] Tests cover reserve timer logic and disabled sizes.
