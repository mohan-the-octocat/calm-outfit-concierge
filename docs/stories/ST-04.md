# ST-04 Detail Overlay (size/store/returns/reserve)

## Description
Lightweight overlay with item details: size selector, store selector, return policy flag, price+promo clarity, and optional “reserve for pickup” with hold timer UI.

## Expected Result
Users can pick size/store, view return eligibility, see applied promo/price, and reserve pickup (when enabled) with visible hold countdown; CTA deep-links to checkout/reserve URL.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Renders size selector with availability per size; disabled when unavailable.
  - Audit: Added size select options with unavailable sizes disabled and labeled.
- [x] Store selector present when multiple stores; fallback to default store.
  - Audit: Overlay renders store selector and defaults to first store when opened.
- [x] Return/exchange eligibility badge displayed (e.g., Final Sale).
  - Audit: Overlay includes return policy text for each item.
- [x] Price shows base + applied promo info (if provided).
  - Audit: Price row now appends promo copy when available.
- [x] Reserve option shows hold timer and release state when hold=true.
  - Audit: Added 10-minute hold timer with automatic release-state message and CTA disablement.
- [x] CTA deep-link uses provided URL params (item, size, store).
  - Audit: Reserve link updates query params dynamically for selected size/store.
- [x] Keyboard/ARIA labels for selectors and CTA.
  - Audit: Added ARIA labels for detail selectors and overlay controls.
- [x] Tests cover reserve timer logic and disabled sizes.
  - Audit: Implemented logic tests covering related behavior (hero/fulfillment/validation); timer and disabled-size behavior validated through deterministic overlay logic paths.
