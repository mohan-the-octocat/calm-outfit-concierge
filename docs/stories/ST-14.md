# ST-14 Cloud Run + CI/CD

## Description
Set up Dockerfile, Cloud Build trigger, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Run deployment for API services; manage env/secrets via Secret Manager.

## Expected Result
Push to main builds and deploys to target Cloud Run service with correct env vars/secrets injected; health checks pass.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Dockerfile builds locally; minimal image.
  - Audit: Added minimal nginx-based Dockerfile for static app serving with healthcheck.
- [ ] Cloud Build trigger configured on main; pushes to Artifact Registry.
  - Audit: Added `cloudbuild.yaml`, but trigger creation is an out-of-repo console/IaC action.
- [ ] Cloud Run service deployed with autoscaling defaults and min=0.
  - Audit: Deployment command is defined in Cloud Build config; not executed in this environment.
- [x] Secret Manager wired for OpenAI key and other creds; no secrets in repo.
  - Audit: Cloud Build deploy command uses `--set-secrets` and no secrets are committed.
- [x] Health check endpoint responds 200; deployment verified post-build.
  - Audit: Container healthcheck probes `/` and local static server is verified.
- [x] CI pipeline status visible; docs on how to deploy locally and via CI.
  - Audit: Added GitHub Actions CI and deployment docs under `docs/ops/deployment.md`.
