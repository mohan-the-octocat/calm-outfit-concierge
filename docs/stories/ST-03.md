# ST-03 Fulfillment Rail (pickup/shipping)

## Description
Component that displays pickup ETA and shipping options (same-day/express/standard) ordered by earliest arrival, with cut-off clocks and past-cutoff handling.

## Expected Result
Given SLA payload, shows options sorted by earliest arrival; highlights fastest; handles passed cut-off by hiding or labeling as next-day; shows pickup as fastest when applicable.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accepts SLA JSON and renders pickup + shipping options with ETA text.
- [ ] Sorts by earliest arrival; highlights fastest option.
- [ ] Cut-off times respected per timezone; past-cutoff shows next-eligible window.
- [ ] Graceful fallback when SLA missing: show pickup-first.
- [ ] Responsive and keyboard accessible.
- [ ] Unit tests cover cut-off logic and ordering.
